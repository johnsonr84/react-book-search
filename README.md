  ## Description 
  A React-based Google Books Search app with helper/util functions and React Hooks to query and display books based on user searches. It also uses Node, Express, MongoDB and is deployed to Heroku.

  ## UserStory 
  ```
  As a user, I want to be able to search for books, view details of a book on Google Books, and "Save" as well as 'Delete" a book.
  ```
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  ``` 
  * This application requires at minimum 2 pages, check out the following mockup images for each page:

    1. Start by using the [01-Ins_Mern/create-react-express](../01-Activities/01-Ins_Mern/create-react-express) example as a base for your application.

    2. Add code to connect to a MongoDB database named `googlebooks` using the mongoose npm package.

    3. Using mongoose, then create a Book schema.

    4. At a minimum, books should have each of the following fields:

    * `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API

    * `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API

    * `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API

    * `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API

    * `link` - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API
  ```
